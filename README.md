## About The Project
Automatically reconnects your computer to a designated Wi-Fi network every arbitrary interval if it's not connected to the internet.

## Setup
1. Copy AutoReconnectWi-Fi.bat's text and paste it into any text editor of your choosing.
3. Rename the `WI-FI_NETWORK_NAME` placeholder to your desired Wi-Fi connection. Keep the name enclosed in quotation marks.
4. Optionally, set the interval of how often (in seconds) you want the script to repeat by adjusting the integer that follows after the "timeout" command. By default, the script is set to execute every 15 minutes.
5. Save the file, and rename the file extension to .bat.
6. Run the file as an administrator (this is a required permission to restart the network adapter).
